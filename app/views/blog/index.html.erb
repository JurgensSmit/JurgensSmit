	<h4> <td>A brief introduction</td> </h4>
	<p>
	<td>My name is Jurgens Smit. My background is in System
	Engineering. I'm originally I’m from Cape Town, South Africa. I enjoy travelling,
	solving problems, and being outdoors.
	<br>
	<p>Currently I’m in Sydney, and I’m really enjoying exploring
	all the social and cultural aspects of the city.</p>

	<p>I believe software and the internet has an amazing ability
	to transform the world for the better. In whatever small and insignificant way
	possible, I want to be one of the people building software to bring about those
	solutions.</p>
	<br>
	<p>This blog will be dedicated to my personal journey of
	becoming a programmer.</p></td>

	<h4> Why Sydney Dev Camp? </h4>
	<p>
	I’m strongly motivated by a desire to learn and better
	myself in everything I do.

	</p><p>I tried learning online, through books and a lot of really
	good resources. I found out that wasn’t the right approach for me. It was hard
	to keep motivated.</p>

	<p>Nothing is comparable to setting your life aside and moving
	to another continent to immerse yourself in learning a new skill for 10 weeks.
	It is amazing being with likeminded people who are trying to change their lives
	and being part of a great community.</p>

	<p>The most exciting thing is that I have the ability to change
	the world, from my keyboard. This is how I came to be at Sydney Dev Camp.</p>

	<h4> Sydney </h4>
	<p>
	I like to seek out and pursue experiences and I’m really
	enjoying all the social and cultural aspects Sydney has to offer.
	<p>I don’t always realize I’m in Sydney, since I spend most of my time coding. I’ve been exploring the city on the odd day, including a trip to
	the Blue Mountains. I’ve been extremely fortunate in meeting amazing people and
	sharing unforgettable adventures with them.</p>

	<p>I don’t think I’ll ever get used to the fact that it rains
	most days and the bizarre sounds of the birds. I’m currently investigating the
	awful sound in the morning; I think it’s a crow.</p>

	<h4> My Experiences So Far </h4>
	<p>
	I wake up and can’t wait to get to Sydney Dev Camp.

	</p><p>I’m consistently being pushed to my limits, learning more
	than ever before all while having more fun than I ever thought possible.</p>

	<p>My experience overall has been great. I have learned more
	than I thought was possible, I have made friends for life and have worked on
	various interesting projects.</p>

	<p><br></p>

	<p><em>I want to do more, to be more
	and to build more.</em></p>

	<h4>Week 3 </h4>
	<p>

	<em>It has been 3 weeks since I started the program, it seems like I have
	been here for months.</em>

	</p><p>I am putting in 12+ hours a day of coding and the only thing that makes it
	possible is the fact that I am surrounded with people with the same passion for
	learning that I have. I am completely focused on the course and putting
	everything into it.</p>

	<p>There will always be something new to learn, some new technology or a new
	technique to take advantage of. This is only the beginning.</p>
	<br>
	<p><em><b>Understanding when to work
	long hours and when to take it easy is definitely a learning process</b>.</em>

	 <h4>Another productive week! </h4>
	<p>

	<p>I have several personal projects which I’m working on during my spare time. <a href="http://smitter.herokuapp.com/">Smitter </a> and <a href="http://smitbook.herokuapp.com/">Smitbook</a> will soon be replacing Twitter and Facebook if everything goes according to plan.</p>

	</p><p>We’ve been collaborating together using Github and getting more used to Test-driven development , which I’ve been enjoying quite a bit. We’re starting to dive deeper into more advanced Ruby on Rails concepts. I’m still trying to get my head around some of the more complicated topics, including database relationships.</p>

	<p>This week was challenging, but I feel confident about the weeks ahead.</p>
	<br>
	<p><em><b>Watch out Facebook and Twitter!</b></em>

			 <h4>Angelhack</h4>
	<p>

	<p>I had the chance to attend Angelhack Sydney this weekend, where I worked on Mizzy. A platform which enables music lovers to connect with teachers, giving them an opportunity to learn an instrument through Google Hangouts.</p>

	</p><p>We had some challenges and we weren’t quite sure what to expect since this was our first time attending Angelhack. We could’ve planned and tested our idea better beforehand and polished our presentation a bit. I think we were more concerned with the technology and not about the fact that people want shiny and ultimately judge with their eyes.</p>

	<p>It’s amazing what we achieved in under 24 hours and I’m extremely happy with the outcome. I got a Blackberry z10 for our efforts. Score!</p>
	<br>
	<p>Overall it was a great experience and I can’t wait for the next one!</p>

			 <h4>Projects</h4>
	<p>

	<p>I’ve been replicating my favorite websites in an effort to learn Ruby on Rails better, I can’t think of a better way to learn. I think it is important doing something you genuinely enjoy, otherwise you’re just wasting your time and it’ll show in your work.</p>

	</p><p>Some might say I spend way too much time on Reddit, so I thought it’ll be a good idea to make my own version of it – <a href="http://smitted.herokuapp.com/">Smitted</a>. I’m sure I’ll have it filled with cat videos soon.</p>

	<p>I’ve also been working on <a href="http://smithub.herokuapp.com/">Smithub</a>, which was created using the Github API to generate a score based on the events feed.</p>
