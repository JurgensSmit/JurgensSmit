	<p>
	<td>My name is Jurgens Smit. My background is in System
	Engineering. I'm originally I’m from Cape Town, South Africa. I enjoy travelling,
	solving problems, and being outdoors.
	<br>
	<p>Currently I’m in Sydney, and I’m really enjoying exploring
	all the social and cultural aspects of the city.</p>

	<p>I believe software and the internet has an amazing ability
	to transform the world for the better. In whatever small and insignificant way
	possible, I want to be one of the people building software to bring about those
	solutions.</p>
	<br>
	<p>This blog will be dedicated to my personal journey of
	becoming a programmer.</p></td>

	<h4> Why Sydney Dev Camp? </h4>
	<p>
	I’m strongly motivated by a desire to learn and better
	myself in everything I do.

	</p><p>I tried learning online, through books and a lot of really
	good resources. I found out that wasn’t the right approach for me. It was hard
	to keep motivated.</p>

	<p>Nothing is comparable to setting your life aside and moving
	to another continent to immerse yourself in learning a new skill for 10 weeks.
	It is amazing being with likeminded people who are trying to change their lives
	and being part of a great community.</p>

	<p>The most exciting thing is that I have the ability to change
	the world, from my keyboard. This is how I came to be at Sydney Dev Camp.</p>

	<h4> Sydney </h4>
	<p>
	I like to seek out and pursue experiences and I’m really
	enjoying all the social and cultural aspects Sydney has to offer.
	<p>I don’t always realize I’m in Sydney, since I spend most of my time coding. I’ve been exploring the city on the odd day, including a trip to
	the Blue Mountains. I’ve been extremely fortunate in meeting amazing people and
	sharing unforgettable adventures with them.</p>

	<p>I don’t think I’ll ever get used to the fact that it rains
	most days and the bizarre sounds of the birds. I’m currently investigating the
	awful sound in the morning; I think it’s a crow.</p>

	<h4> My Experiences So Far </h4>
	<p>
	I wake up and can’t wait to get to Sydney Dev Camp.

	</p><p>I’m consistently being pushed to my limits, learning more
	than ever before all while having more fun than I ever thought possible.</p>

	<p>My experience overall has been great. I have learned more
	than I thought was possible, I have made friends for life and have worked on
	various interesting projects.</p>

	<p><br></p>

	<p><em>I want to do more, to be more
	and to build more.</em></p>

	<h4>Week 3 </h4>
	<p>

	<em>It has been 3 weeks since I started the program, it seems like I have
	been here for months.</em>

	</p><p>I am putting in 12+ hours a day of coding and the only thing that makes it
	possible is the fact that I am surrounded with people with the same passion for
	learning that I have. I am completely focused on the course and putting
	everything into it.</p>

	<p>There will always be something new to learn, some new technology or a new
	technique to take advantage of. This is only the beginning.</p>
	<br>
	<p><em><b>Understanding when to work
	long hours and when to take it easy is definitely a learning process</b>.</em>

	 <h4>Another productive week! </h4>
	<p>

	<p>I have several personal projects which I’m working on during my spare time. <a href="http://smitter.herokuapp.com/">Smitter </a> and <a href="http://smitbook.herokuapp.com/">Smitbook</a> will soon be replacing Twitter and Facebook if everything goes according to plan.</p>

	</p><p>We’ve been collaborating together using Github and getting more used to Test-driven development , which I’ve been enjoying quite a bit. We’re starting to dive deeper into more advanced Ruby on Rails concepts. I’m still trying to get my head around some of the more complicated topics, including database relationships.</p>

	<p>This week was challenging, but I feel confident about the weeks ahead.</p>

	<p><em><b>Watch out Facebook and Twitter!</b></em>
